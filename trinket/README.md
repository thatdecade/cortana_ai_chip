## 3D Printing:

The Cortana Data Chipâ€™s 3D model was designed by Dylan Powell. I modified the Halo Cortana Chip to fit the neopixel jewel and usb plug. Model is prescaled to 125%. Download: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4891701

I printed the Data Chip with 0.20 layer height as a color change job at 2.80mm. Dark grey and then Silver.

## Assembly and Wiring:
* Trinket #0 to Neopixel Data In
* Trinket #1 to Button LED
* Trinket #2 to Button Switch

I wired the neopixel through the USB socket.  V+ and GND I kept on pins 1 and 4, neopixel data wire on one of the data pins.  This ensures that if the USB is plugged into a real USB port, nothing will break.

## Arduino:
The code was based on an adafruit example for the trinket. I wrote about 10 animations, inspired by my previous energy sword builds.
