## 3D Printing:

The Cortana Data Chipâ€™s 3D model was designed by Dylan Powell. I modified the Halo Cortana Chip to fit the neopixel jewel and magnet pin connector. Model is prescaled to 125%. Download: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4891701

I printed the Data Chip with 0.20 layer height as a color change job at 2.80mm. Dark grey and then Silver.

## Assembly and Wiring:
* WEMOS D0 to Neopixel Data In
* WEMOS D1 to Button LED
* WEMOS D2 to Button Switch

The magnet connector has straight pins (not solder cup friendly).  Recommend using 30 AWG Wrapping Wire around the pins using a wire wrap tool, then soldering.
